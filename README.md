# HITE
This repository contains the source code to calculate the "Habitability Index for Transiting Exoplanets" or HITE. The code is written in C, and I provide input files for Earth (if it were observed to transit) as well as Kepler-452 b. If you use this code, please cite Barnes, Meadows & Evans (2015), ApJ, 814, 91. To use this code, compile hite.c with a C compiler, then to run:

> hite earth.in

This will produce an output file hite.out that contains the results.
