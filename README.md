# HITE
This repository contains the source code to calculate the "Habitability Index for Transiting Exoplanets" or HITE. The code is written in C, and I provide input files for Earth (if it were observed to transit) as well as Kepler-452 b.If you use this code, please cite Barnes, Meadows & Evans (2015), ApJ, 814, 91.
